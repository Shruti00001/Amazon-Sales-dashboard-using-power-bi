 📊 Amazon Sales Reporting Survey Dashboard

🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard was built to explore and solve inefficiencies in Amazon’s sales reporting workflows. The project began with a simulated survey (poll) designed to mimic real-world feedback from sales professionals. Using synthetic data generated from that poll, we analyzed reporting challenges, tool usage, and time spent on manual reporting tasks. The result is a recruiter-ready Power BI dashboard backed by a detailed case study.

🎯 Business Problem

Sales teams often spend excessive time on manual reporting, using fragmented tools like Excel or outdated workflows. This leads to delays, data inconsistencies, and frustration. Our goal was to understand these pain points and propose a dashboard solution that could streamline reporting and improve decision-making.

 🧠 Case Study: Key Insights from the Survey

 1. Top Challenges in Reporting
A pie chart visualized the most common challenges faced by Amazon’s sales team:
- 🔹 Data accuracy
- 🔹 Data completeness
- 🔹 Timeliness of reporting
- 🔹 Tool limitations

> These insights validated the need for a centralized, automated dashboard solution.

 2. Distribution of Monthly Reporting Time
A histogram-style chart grouped respondents by how many hours they spend on reporting each month:
- ⏱️ Majority fell into the 8–16 hour range
- ⏳ Some outliers spent over 20 hours

> This highlighted a major inefficiency and justified the time-saving potential of a dashboard.

3. Reporting Tool Usage by Region
A stacked bar chart showed how different regions rely on different tools:
- 📊 Excel dominated across all regions
- 🟣 Power BI adoption was highest in the West
- 🟠 Tableau and “None” were minimal

> This helped identify where dashboard adoption would be easiest and where training might be needed.

4. KPI Cards
We created key performance indicators to summarize the most impactful metrics:
- 📌 **Average Monthly Reporting Time**: ~12.4 hours
- 📌 **% Interested in Dashboard Solution**: 401 out of 1,200 respondents (~33.4%)
- 📌 **Excel Usage Rate**: ~60%
- 📌 **Power BI Usage Rate**: ~25%

> These KPIs give recruiters and stakeholders instant insight into the problem and its potential solution.
