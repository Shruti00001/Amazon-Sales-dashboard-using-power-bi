 📊 Amazon Sales Reporting Survey Dashboard

🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard is the result of a full-cycle analytics project—from ideation to execution. I began by designing a simulated survey poll to reflect real-world challenges faced by Amazon’s sales reporting teams. Using the poll responses, I generated a synthetic dataset, cleaned and structured it, and then conducted a deep dive analysis using Power BI.

The goal was to uncover inefficiencies in reporting workflows, visualize tool usage across regions, and quantify interest in dashboard solutions. Every visual, KPI, and insight in this dashboard is backed by thoughtful research, strategic design, and hands-on data modeling.

🎯 Business Problem

Sales teams often spend excessive time on manual reporting, using fragmented tools like Excel or outdated workflows. This leads to delays, data inconsistencies, and frustration. Our goal was to understand these pain points and propose a dashboard solution that could streamline reporting and improve decision-making.

🧠 Case Study: From Poll to Dashboard
This wasn’t just a dashboard—it was a research-driven case study. Here’s how it unfolded:
- Poll Design & Data Generation
I created a simulated survey targeting Amazon sales professionals. The poll included questions about reporting time, tool usage, challenges faced, and interest in dashboard solutions. The responses were used to build a structured dataset (amazon_survey_data.csv) that mimics real-world business feedback.

- Data Exploration & Insight Discovery
Using Power BI, I explored the dataset to uncover patterns:
- Pie chart: Top reporting challenges
- Histogram: Time spent on monthly reporting
- Stacked bar: Tool usage by region
- KPI cards: Dashboard interest, Excel vs Power BI usage
- Dashboard Design & Storytelling
- 
I built a clean, recruiter-friendly dashboard with interactive visuals and KPI cards. Each visual was chosen to support a specific business insight and tell a cohesive story.
- Documentation & Portfolio Branding
I documented the entire process in this README, added screenshots, and published the .pbix file for transparency. This project is now part of my portfolio and reflects my ability to take a business problem from concept to solution.

 🧠 Case Study: Key Insights from the Survey

 1. Top Challenges in Reporting
A pie chart visualized the most common challenges faced by Amazon’s sales team:
- 🔹 Data accuracy
- 🔹 Data completeness
- 🔹 Timeliness of reporting
- 🔹 Tool limitations

> These insights validated the need for a centralized, automated dashboard solution.

 2. Distribution of Monthly Reporting Time
A histogram-style chart grouped respondents by how many hours they spend on reporting each month:
- ⏱️ Majority fell into the 8–16 hour range
- ⏳ Some outliers spent over 20 hours

> This highlighted a major inefficiency and justified the time-saving potential of a dashboard.

---

3. Reporting Tool Usage by Region
A stacked bar chart showed how different regions rely on different tools:
- 📊 Excel dominated across all regions
- 🟣 Power BI adoption was highest in the West
- 🟠 Tableau and “None” were minimal

> This helped identify where dashboard adoption would be easiest and where training might be needed.

4. KPI Cards
We created key performance indicators to summarize the most impactful metrics:
- 📌 **Average Monthly Reporting Time**: ~12.4 hours
- 📌 **% Interested in Dashboard Solution**: 401 out of 1,200 respondents (~33.4%)
- 📌 **Excel Usage Rate**: ~60%
- 📌 **Power BI Usage Rate**: ~25%

> These KPIs give recruiters and stakeholders instant insight into the problem and its potential solution.
